<h1>iHart - Interactive Hallways for Attraction and Retention in Technology</h1>
<div class="description">
From <a href="">the original iHart website</a>:
<p>
 iHart allows users to create hallways that react as people as they walk by. With a simple camera and projector, iHart can create snowflakes as someone walks down the hall, or create wind that blows leaves in the direction that a person is walking. It allows hallways to come alive, leading passerby to interact with their surroundings. They can become the controller for a computer game by stepping onto a floor projection, or they can stretch their hands up towards a collection of flowers hanging from the ceiling--quite possibly expecting no response at all--only to be surprised when music plays in response. The possibilities are nearly unlimited, and are bound only by the developerâ€™s imagination.
</p>
<p>
            The goal of iHart goes beyond creating hallways that are fun and interesting to walk through: it aims to engage the attention of passerby and to increase their interest in technology. iHart allows inexperienced programmers to create Applications with rewarding graphics and functionality. Hopefully, the project garners greater interest in computer science by intriguing passerby and giving them an achievable opportunity to create dynamic Applications that would be rewarding both to create and to walk past.
