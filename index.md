# iHart MHC

 iHart allows users to create hallways that react as people as they walk by. With a simple camera and 
 projector, iHart can create snowflakes as someone walks down the hall, or create wind that blows leaves 
 in the direction that a person is walking. It allows hallways to come alive, leading passerby to 
 interact with their surroundings. They can become the controller for a computer game by stepping onto a 
 floor projection, or they can stretch their hands up towards a collection of flowers hanging from the 
 ceiling, quite possibly expecting no response at all, only to be surprised when music plays in response. 
 The possibilities are nearly unlimited, and are bound only by the developerâ€™s imagination.

            
The goal of iHart goes beyond creating hallways that are fun and interesting to walk through: it aims to 
engage the attention of passerby and to increase their interest in technology. iHart allows inexperienced 
programmers to create Applications with rewarding graphics and functionality. Hopefully, the project 
garners greater interest in computer science by intriguing passerby and giving them an achievable 
opportunity to create dynamic Applications that would be rewarding both to create and to walk past.
