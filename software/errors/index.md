# Troubleshooting the iHart software

### Force quit the camera
This problem has been fixed in a version of iHart that will be released soon. 
For now, use the Activity Monitor or the Task Manager to quit the \"cvServer\" process.

### Help windows do not show up
When sliding the \'help\' trackbar to the right, an empty window might appear instead of a window with help information.
We are working on this; in the meantime, the same help information can be found [here](/).
